*in this folder, an example of the artifacts from github is checked in*

The pipeline automatically generates artifacts like a pdf test-report. The 
Artifacts can be downloaded here: 
https://github.com/leahcim-design/astroDynamics/actions/workflows/matlab-pipeline.yml .
After clicking on the respective run, the artifacts are displayed in the 
lower part and can be downloaded.

For convenience and to get a feeling for the look of the test-report, the 
latest version is checked in here.
